# PHP_SLIM_RESTfulAPI_api-with-jwt-auth

This is a simple implementation of a simple RESTful API with JWT Auth in PHP with the help of SLIM microframework
. This repo contains two folders, one without JWT auth, and one with JWT.

Steps to implement JWT authentication:

1. Import SLIM microframework (https://github.com/slimphp/Slim) and JWT Support Library by Firebase (https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt).
2. Put them in 'libs' folder.
3. Just have a look at the comments in the code! :D
